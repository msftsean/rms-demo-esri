# - Production deployments use only k8s/overlays/azure/ with Microsoft Container Registry images
# - Development workflow preserved while maintaining production security compliance

# kubectl apply -k k8s/dev/  # Development only
# kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/azure/  # Production compliant

    to provide full development functionality. These are excluded from production
    security scanning and should never be deployed to production environments.
