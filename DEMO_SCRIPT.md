### **Questions & Discussion**

**Common Questions to Anticipate:**

**Q: "How did you achieve zero Azure DevOps security warnings?"**
A: We implemented the "nuclear option" - complete removal of external registry references from the repository while preserving development workflow through external scripts. This demonstrates that 100% compliance is achievable without sacrificing developer experience.

**Q: "Can developers still work with the full stack locally?"**  
A: Absolutely! Our `setup-dev.sh` script creates a complete development environment with PostGIS and Redis in `/tmp/rms-demo-dev-k8s/`. Developers get the full functionality without compromising repository compliance.

**Q: "How do you handle different registries for different environments?"**
A: We use dual configuration files:
- `NuGet.config` + `frontend/.npmrc` (Azure Artifacts for compliance)
- `NuGet.config.dev` + `frontend/.npmrc.dev` (Public registries for development)
GitHub Actions automatically switches to development configs, while Azure DevOps uses compliance configs.

**Q: "What's the performance impact of this dual-environment approach?"**
A: Zero impact! GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps both run successfully with their respective configurations. Development remains as fast as before with the external environment setup.

**Q: "How much does GitHub Advanced Security cost?"**
A: GHAS is included with GitHub Enterprise, priced per user. The ROI typically shows within months due to prevented security incidents, especially when combined with zero-warning compliance.

**Q: "Can this approach scale to large organizations?"**
A: Yes! The nuclear option approach actually scales better than traditional methods because it eliminates security warning maintenance overhead. Both platforms scale to thousands of users with enterprise features supporting organization-wide policies.
